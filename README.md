# Deadliner

This program will allow students of New York University to retrieve their deadlines from NYU Classes and create google calendar events for them. No data will be stored. 

1. Clone/download the git repo into a folder on your computer. 
2. Open details.py and enter your netid and password in the respective places.
2. In terminal, access the folder and run "python3 setup.py install".
3. Then type "python3 quickstart.py".
4. A broswer window should open asking you to authenticate the google accoutn you wish to use, then close after authentication flow has completed.
5. Another browser window will open which will prompt MFA on your device. Accept it and then leave the program to run.
6. A summary of the classes should be printed on your terminal with the times and a google calendar event will be created right after. 

Enjoy using this and feel free to contact me at gdk244@nyu.edu for any issues encountered.
